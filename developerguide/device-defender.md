 is an IoT security service that allows you to audit the configuration of your devices, monitor connected devices to detect abnormal behavior, and to mitigate security risks\. It gives you the ability to enforce consistent security policies across your AWS IoT device fleet and respond quickly when devices are compromised\. 

IoT fleets may consist of large numbers of devices that have diverse capabilities, are long\-lived, and are geographically distributed\. These characteristics make fleet setup complex and error\-prone\. And since devices are often constrained in computational power, memory, and storage capabilities, this limits the use of encryption and other forms of security on the devices themselves\. Also, devices often use software with known vulnerabilities\. The combination of these factors makes IoT fleets an attractive target for hackers and make it difficult to secure your device fleet on an ongoing basis\.

 addresses these challenges by providing tools to identify security issues and deviations from best practices\.  can audit device fleets to ensure they adhere to security best practices and detect abnormal behavior on devices\.
