# SELECT Clause<a name="iot-sql-select"></a>

The AWS IoT SELECT clause is essentially the same as the ANSI SQL SELECT clause, with some minor differences\.

You can use the SELECT clause to extract information from incoming MQTT messages\. `SELECT *` can be used to retrieve the entire incoming message payload\. For example:

```
Incoming payload published on topic 'a/b': {"color":"red", "temperature":50}
SQL statement: SELECT * FROM 'a/b'
Outgoing payload: {"color":"red", "temperature":50}
```

If the payload is a JSON object, you can reference keys in the object\. Your outgoing payload contains the key\-value pair\. For example:

```
Incoming payload published on topic 'a/b': {"color":"red", "temperature":50}
SQL statement: SELECT color FROM 'a/b'
Outgoing payload: {"color":"red"}
```

You can use the AS keyword to rename keys\. For example:

```
Incoming payload published on topic 'a/b':{"color":"red", "temperature":50}
SQL:SELECT color AS my_color FROM 'a/b'
Outgoing payload: {"my_color":"red"}
```

You can select multiple items by separating them with a comma\. For example:

```
Incoming payload published on topic 'a/b': {"color":"red", "temperature":50}
SQL: SELECT color as my_color, temperature as farenheit FROM 'a/b'
Outgoing payload: {"my_color":"red","farenheit":50}
```

You can select multiple items including '\*' to add items to the incoming payload\. For example:

```
Incoming payload published on topic 'a/b': {"color":"red", "temperature":50}
SQL: SELECT *, 15 as speed FROM 'a/b'
Outgoing payload: {"color":"red", "temperature":50, "speed":15}
```

You can use the `"VALUE"` keyword to produce outgoing payloads that are not JSON objects\. You may only select one item\. For example:

```
Incoming payload published on topic 'a/b': {"color":"red", "temperature":50}
SQL: SELECT VALUE color FROM 'a/b'
Outgoing payload: "red"
```

You can use `'.'` syntax to drill into nested JSON objects in the incoming payload\. For example:

```
Incoming payload published on topic 'a/b': {"color":{"red":255,"green":0,"blue":0}, "temperature":50}
SQL: SELECT color.red as red_value FROM 'a/b'
Outgoing payload: {"red_value":255}
```

You can use functions \(see [Functions](iot-sql-functions.md)\) to transform the incoming payload\. Parentheses can be used for grouping\. For example:

```
Incoming payload published on topic 'a/b': {"color":"red", "temperature":50}
SQL: SELECT (temperature â€“ 32) * 5 / 9 AS celsius, upper(color) as my_color FROM 'a/b'
Outgoing payload: {"celsius":10,"my_color":"RED"}
```

## Working with Binary Payloads<a name="binary-payloads"></a>

When the message payload should be handled as raw binary data \(rather than a JSON object\), you can use the \* operator to refer to it in a `SELECT` clause\.

These rules must be followed to use \* to refer to the message payload as raw binary data:

1. The SQL statement and templates must not refer to JSON names other than \*\. 

1. The SELECT statement must have \* as the only item, or must have only functions, for example:

   ```
   SELECT * FROM 'a/b'
   ```

   ```
   SELECT encode(*, 'base64') AS data, timestamp() AS ts FROM 'a/b'
   ```

### Binary Payload Examples<a name="binary-payloads-examples"></a>

The following `SELECT` clause can be used with binary payloads because it doesn't refer to any JSON names\.

```
SELECT * FROM 'a/b'
```

The following `SELECT` cannot be used with binary payloads because it refers to `device_type` in the WHERE clause\.

```
SELECT * FROM 'a/b' WHERE device_type = 'thermostat'
```

The following `SELECT` cannot be used with binary payloads because it violates rule \#2\.

```
SELECT *, timestamp() AS timestamp FROM 'a/b'
```

The following `SELECT` can be used with binary payloads because it doesn't violate rule \#1 or rule \#2\.

```
SELECT * FROM 'a/b' WHERE timestamp() % 12 = 0
```

The following AWS IoT rule cannot be used with binary payloads because it violates rule \#1\.

```
{
    "sql": "SELECT * FROM 'a/b'"
    "actions": [{
        "republish": {
            "topic":"device/${device_id}"
         }
     }]
}
```
