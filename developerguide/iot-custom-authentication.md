# Custom Authentication<a name="iot-custom-authentication"></a>

AWS IoT allows you to define custom authorizers that allow you to manage your own authentication and authorization strategy using a custom authentication service and a Lambda function\. Custom authorizers allow AWS IoT to authenticate your devices and authorize operations using bearer token authentication and authorization strategies\.

When an HTTP connection is established \(and optionally upgraded to a WebSocket connection\) and Signature Version 4 headers are not present, the AWS IoT device gateway checks if a custom authorizer is configured for the endpoint, and if so, it is used to authenticate the connection and authorize the device\. Custom authorizers can implement various authentication strategies \(for example: JWT verification, OAuth provider callout, and so on\) and must return policy documents that are used by the device gateway to authorize MQTT operations\.
