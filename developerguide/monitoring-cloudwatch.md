# Monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch<a name="monitoring-cloudwatch"></a>

You can monitor AWS IoT using CloudWatch, which collects and processes raw data from AWS IoT into readable, near real\-time metrics\. These statistics are recorded for a period of two weeks, so that you can access historical information and gain a better perspective on how your web application or service is performing\. By default, AWS IoT metric data is sent automatically to CloudWatch in one minute intervals\. For more information, see [What Are Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon CloudWatch Events, and Amazon CloudWatch Logs?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/WhatIsCloudWatch.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.
