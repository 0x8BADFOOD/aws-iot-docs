# CloudWatch Log Entry Format<a name="cwl-format"></a>

Each component of AWS IoT generates its own logs\. Each log entry has an `eventType` that indicates which operation caused the log to be generated\. This section describes the logs generated by the following AWS IoT components:
+ [Message broker](#message-broker-logs)
+ [Device Shadow service](#device-shadow-logs)
+ [Rules engine](#rule-engine-logs)
+ [Jobs](#job-logs)
+ [Device provisioning logs](#provision-logs)
+ [Dynamic Thing Groups Logs](#dynamic-group-logs)

All CloudWatch Logs have the following common attributes:

timestamp  
The UNIX timestamp of when the client connected to the AWS IoT message broker\.

logLevel  
The log level being used\. For more information, see [Log Level](cloud-watch-logs.md#log-level)\.

traceId  
A randomly generated identifier that can be used to correlate all logs for a specific request\.

accountId  
Your AWS account ID\.

status  
The status of the request\.

eventType  
The event type for which the log was generated\. The value of the event type for each event is listed in the following sections\.

## Dynamic Thing Group Logs<a name="dynamic-group-logs"></a>

AWS IoT Dynamic Thing Groups generate logs for the following event\.

------
#### [ AddThingToDynamicThingGroupsFailed event ]

AWS IoT was not able to add a thing to the specified dynamic groups\.

A thing met the criteria to be in the dynamic thing group; however, it could not be added to the dynamic group or it was removed from the dynamic group\. This can happen because:
+ The thing already belongs to the maximum number of groups\.
+ The \-\-override\-dynamic\-groups option was used to add the thing to a static thing group\. It was removed from a dynamic thing group to make that possible\.

For more information, see [Dynamic Thing Group Limitations and Conflicts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/dynamic-thing-groups.html#dynamic-thing-group-limitations)\.

------
#### [ More info \(17\) ]

This example shows the log entry of an `AddThingToDynamicThingGroupsFailed` error\. In this example, *TestThing* met the criteria to be in the dynamic thing groups listed in `dynamicThingGroupNames`, but could not be added to those dynamic groups, as described in `reason`\.
