# X\.509 Client Certificates<a name="x509-client-certs"></a>

X\.509 certificates provide AWS IoT with the ability to authenticate client and device connections\. Client certificates must be registered with AWS IoT before a client can communicate with AWS IoT\. The same client certificate can be registered in multiple AWS accounts in the same AWS Region and also in multiple AWS Regions\. Client certificates can be registered with AWS IoT before they are used or the first time they are used to connect to AWS IoT\. 

We recommend that each device or client be given a unique certificate to enable fine\-grained client management actions, including certificate revocation\. Devices and clients must also support rotation and replacement of certificates to help ensure smooth operation as certificates expire\.

For information about using X\.509 certificates to support more than a few devices, see [Device Provisioning](iot-provision.md) to review the different certificate management and provisioning options that AWS IoT supports\.

**AWS IoT supports these types of X\.509 client certificates:**
+  X\.509 certificates generated by AWS IoT
+  X\.509 certificates signed by a CA registered with AWS IoT\.
+  X\.509 certificates signed by a CA that is not registered with AWS IoT\.

**Note**  
 If you want to use a client certificate to authenticate a client in multiple AWS accounts in the same Region, use a client certificate that is not signed by a CA that is registered with AWS IoT\. 

This section describes how to manage X\.509 certificates in AWS IoT\. You can use the AWS IoT console or AWS CLI to perform these certificate operations:
+ [Create AWS IoT Client Certificates](device-certs-create.md)
+ [Create Your Own Client Certificates](device-certs-your-own.md)
+ [Register a Client Certificate](register-device-cert.md)
+ [Activate or Deactivate a Client Certificate](activate-or-deactivate-device-cert.md)
+ [Revoke a Client Certificate](revoke-ca-cert.md)

For more information about the AWS CLI commands that perform these operations, see [AWS IoT CLI Reference](docs.aws.amazon.comcli/latest/reference/iot/index.html)\.

## Using X\.509 Client Certificates<a name="x509-client-cert-basics"></a>

X\.509 certificates authenticate client and device connections to AWS IoT\. X\.509 certificates provide several benefits over other identification and authentication mechanisms\. X\.509 certificates enable asymmetric keys to be used with devices\. For example, you could burn private keys into secure storage on a device so that sensitive cryptographic material never leaves the device\. X\.509 certificates provide stronger client authentication over other schemes, such as user name and password or bearer tokens, because the private key never leaves the device\.

AWS IoT authenticates client certificates using the TLS protocol's client authentication mode\. TLS support is available in many programming languages and operating systems and is commonly used for encrypting data\. In TLS client authentication, AWS IoT requests an X\.509 client certificate and validates the certificate's status and AWS account against a registry of certificates\. It then challenges the client for proof of ownership of the private key that corresponds to the public key contained in the certificate\. AWS IoT requires clients to send the [Server Name Indication \(SNI\) extension](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3546#section-3.1) to the Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) protocol\. For more information on configuring the SNI extension, see [Transport Security in AWS IoT](transport-security.md)\.

X\.509 certificates can be verified against a trusted certificate authority \(CA\)\. You can create client certificates that use the Amazon Root CA and you can use your own client certificates signed by another CA\. For more information about using your own X\.509 certificates, see [Create Your Own Client Certificates](device-certs-your-own.md)\.

The date and time when certificates signed by a CA certificate expire are set when the certificate is created\. X\.509 certificates generated by AWS IoT expire at midnight UTC on December 31, 2049 \(2049\-12\-31T23:59:59Z\)\. For more information about using the AWS IoT console to create certificates that use the Amazon Root CA, see [Create AWS IoT Client Certificates](device-certs-create.md)\.
