# X\.509 Client Certificates<a name="x509-client-certs"></a>

X\.509 certificates provide several benefits over other identification and authentication mechanisms\. X\.509 certificates enable asymmetric keys to be used with devices\. This means you can burn private keys into secure storage on a device\. This way, sensitive cryptographic material never leaves the device\. X\.509 certificates provide stronger client authentication over other schemes, such as user name and password or bearer tokens, because the private key never leaves the device\.

AWS IoT authenticates client certificates using the TLS protocol’s client authentication mode\. TLS is available in many programming languages and operating systems and is commonly used for encrypting data\. In TLS client authentication, AWS IoT requests an X\.509 client certificate and validates the certificate’s status and AWS account against a registry of certificates\. It then challenges the client for proof of ownership of the private key that corresponds to the public key contained in the certificate\.

AWS IoT supports the following client certificate\-signing algorithms:
+ SHA256WITHRSA
+ SHA384WITHRSA
+ SHA512WITHRSA
+ DSA\_WITH\_SHA256
+ ECDSA\-WITH\-SHA256
+ ECDSA\-WITH\-SHA384
+ ECDSA\-WITH\-SHA512

AWS IoT can use AWS IoT\-generated X\.509 certificates or your own X\.509 certificates for device authentication\. X\.509 certificates generated by AWS IoT are long\-lived \(but will expire at 2049\-12\-31T23:59:59Z, that is at midnight GMT on December 31, 2049\.\) The expiry date and time for certificates signed by a CA certificate are set when the certificate is created\.

To use an X\.509 certificate not created by AWS IoT, you must register a CA certificate\. All device certificates must be signed by the CA certificate you register\.

**Note**  
We recommend that each device be given a unique certificate to enable fine\-grained management including certificate revocation\. Devices must support rotation and replacement of certificates in order to ensure smooth operation as certificates expire\.

You can use the AWS IoT console or CLI to perform the following certificate operations:
+ Create and register an AWS IoT certificate\.
+ Register a CA certificate\.
+ Register a device certificate\.
+ Activate or deactivate a device certificate\.
+ Revoke a device certificate\.
+ Transfer a device certificate to another AWS account\.
+ List all CA certificates registered to your AWS account\.
+ List all device certificates registered to your AWS account\.

For more information about the CLI commands to use to perform these operations, see [AWS IoT CLI Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iot/index.html)\.
