# Configure Your Device<a name="configure-iot"></a>

All devices must have a device certificate, private key, and root CA certificate installed in order to communicate with AWS IoT\. Consult your device's documentation to connect to it and copy your device certificate, private key, and root CA certificate onto your device\. 

If you don't have an IoT\-ready device, you can use the MQTT client, the AWS IoT Device SDKs or the AWS CLI\. For more information, see the [AWS IoT SDK Tutorials ](sdk-tutorials.md) section\. The tutorials there use a Raspberry Pi but can easily be adapted for use with other types of computers\.
