# Configure Your Device<a name="configure-iot"></a>

Configuring your device allows it to connect to your Wi\-Fi network\. Your device must be connected to your Wi\-Fi network to install required files and send messages to AWS IoT\. All devices must install a device certificate, private key, and root CA certificate in order to communicate with AWS IoT\.

**Note**  
Pressing the AWS IoT button for 15 seconds will reset it and you will have to reconfigure your Wi\-Fi and device certificate\.

## Configure an AWS IoT Button<a name="test-rule-button"></a>

The easiest way to configure your AWS IoT button is to use the AWS IoT button smart phone app\. You can download it from the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/aws-iot-button/id1178216626) or the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazonaws.iotbutton)\. If you are unable to use the smart phone app, follow these directions to configure your button\.

### Turn on your device<a name="power-on"></a>

1. Remove the AWS IoT button from its packaging, and then press and hold the button until a blue blinking light appears\. \(This should take no longer than 15 seconds\.\)

1. The button acts as a Wi\-Fi access point, so when your computer searches for Wi\-Fi networks, it will find one called **Button ConfigureMe \- XXX** where *XXX* is a three\-character string generated by the button\. Use your computer to connect to the button's Wi\-Fi access point\.
**Note**  
When the blue light stops blinking, the button ceases presenting itself as a Wi\-Fi access point\. Therefore, if you can't complete the following procedure soon enough, you may need to invoke the blue blinking light a few times to do so\. Once configured, the device does not need to present itself as a Wi\-Fi access point and communicates to the internet, just like any other computer, using your local Wi\-Fi network\.

1. The first time you connect to the button's Wi\-Fi access point, you will be prompted for the WPA2\-PSK password\. Type the last 8 characters of the device serial number \(DSN\)\. You'll find the DSN on the back of the device, as shown here:

### Copy your device certificate and private key onto your AWS IoT button<a name="copy-certificate-to-device"></a>

To connect to AWS IoT, you must copy your device certificate and private key onto the AWS IoT button\. 

1. In a browser, navigate to [http://192\.168\.0\.1/index\.html](http://192.168.0.1/index.html)\.

1. Complete the configuration form:

   + Type your Wi\-Fi SSID and password\.

   + Browse to and select your certificate and private key\. For example, `2a540e2346-certificate.pem.crt` and `2a540e2346-private.pem.key`, respectively\.

   + Find your custom endpoint in the [ AWS IoT console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home?region=us-east-1#/dashboard/help)\. \(From the dashboard, in the left navigation pane, choose **Manage**, and then choose **Things**\. Select the box representing your button to show its details page\. On the details page, in the left navigation pane, choose **Interact** and look for the **HTTPS** section, near the top\.\) Your endpoint will look something like the following:

     ```
     ABCDEFG1234567.iot.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
     ```

     where `ABCDEFG1234567` is the subdomain and `us-east-2` is the region\.

   + On the **Button ConfigureMe** page, type the subdomain, and then choose the region that matches the region in your AWS IoT endpoint\. 

   + Select the **Terms and Conditions** check box\. Your settings should now look like the following:

   + Choose **Configure**\. Your button should now connect to your Wi\-Fi network\.

## Configure a Different Device<a name="configure-other-device"></a>

Consult your device's documentation to connect to it and copy your device certificate, private key, and root CA certificate onto your device\.
