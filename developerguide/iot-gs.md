# Getting Started with AWS IoT<a name="iot-gs"></a>

This tutorial shows you how to create resources required to send, receive, and process MQTT messages from devices using AWS IoT\. 

You need the following to complete this tutorial:

+ A computer with Wi\-Fi access\.

+ If you have an AWS IoT button \(pictured here\), you can use it to complete this tutorial\.

+ If you do not have a button, you can purchase one [here](https://www.amazon.com/All-New-AWS-IoT-Button-Generation/dp/B01KW6YCIM/ref=dp_ob_title_def) or you can use the MQTT client in the AWS IoT console to emulate a device\.
