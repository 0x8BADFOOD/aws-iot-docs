# AWS IoT Plant Watering Sample<a name="iot-plant-watering"></a>

This hands\-on sample demonstrates how to use AWS IoT to continually detect the current soil moisture level for a common houseplant\. Whenever the moisture level gets too low, an email alert is sent to the houseplant’s owner as a reminder to water it\.

To get real soil moisture readings, this sample uses hardware such as a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) and a soil moisture sensor kit, and a common houseplant\. If you don’t have this hardware or the houseplant, you can simulate the soil moisture readings by generating random readings from your development computer instead\. This sample shows you both approaches\.
